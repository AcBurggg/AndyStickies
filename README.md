### Purpose of AndyStickies
The "Stickies" app that comes with MacOS doesn't have a keybind to strike through lines which is like half the fun of making a to-do list in the first place. 
It does have the functionality but you need to go to the menu bar, select font, and then select strikethrough which is too much work. 
AndyStickies is just a notepad that can sit on my desktop but Cmd+d strikes through any highlighted text or the current line.
